A lightweight C implementation of the Vigenère cipher.

## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts messages using the Vigenère cipher.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters in the message.

## Usage
1. Compile the code using a C compiler, for example:
    ```sh
    gcc -o vigenere_cipher cipher.c
    ```

2. Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    ./vigenere_cipher
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter the message and the key, and choose the operation (encryption or decryption).
